Description: The GNU Parted disk partition resizing program
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
 resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. This is useful
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
 disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. This package
 contains the Parted binary and manual page.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS and
 PC98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
 disk) type which allows use on RAID/LVM. Filesystems which
 are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (FAT16
 and FAT32), ReiserFS (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
 Parted can also detect and remove HFS (Mac OS), JFS, NTFS,
 UFS (Sun and HP), XFS and ASFS/AFFS/APFS (Amiga) filesystems,
 but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.
 .
 Note that ReiserFS support is only enabled if you install
 the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. Since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
 removed from sarge, ReiserFS support is not compiled in the
 default package.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
 massive data loss. While there are no known bugs at the moment,
 they could exist, so please back up all important files before
 running it, and do so at your own risk.
