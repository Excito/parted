These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* Requirements

Only the sources are installed in the GIT repository (to ease the
maintenance, merges etc.), therefore you will have to get the latest
stable versions of the maintainer tools we depend upon, including:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>
- Wget <http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/>

As of this writing, the latest stable version of Gzip is 1.2.4 but we
suggest using test version 1.3.5 (or later, if one becomes available).

Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> is also highly recommended, if
Valgrind supports your architecture.

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful.
Later, a plain `git-pull && make' should be sufficient.

* First GIT checkout

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to check out
this package from GIT.  The next step is to get other files needed to
build, which are extracted from other source packages:

	$ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

	$ git-diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!
