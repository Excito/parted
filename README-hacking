These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

* Requirements

We've opted to keep only the highest-level sources in the GIT repository.
This eases our maintenance burden, (fewer merges etc.), but imposes more
requirements on anyone wishing to build from the just-checked-out sources.
Specific tools and versions will be checked for and listed by the
bootstrap script shown below, and will include:

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Git <http://git.or.cz/>
- Gzip <http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>
- Perl <http://www.cpan.org/>
- Rsync <http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/>
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- Pkg-config <http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/>
- Tar <http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/>
- Uuid-devel <http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/>
     (Debian: uuid-dev, Red Hat: uuid-devel)

Only building the initial full source tree will be a bit painful.
Later, a plain `git pull && make' should be sufficient.

- Valgrind

Valgrind <http://valgrind.org/> is also highly recommended, if
Valgrind supports your architecture.

- XZ utils (successor to LZMA)

This package's build procedure uses XZ to create a compressed
distribution tarball.  Using this feature of Automake requires
version 1.10a or newer, as well as the xz program itself.
Make sure you have the latest version of the XZ Utils from
<http://tukaani.org/lzma/download>.

* First GIT checkout

You can get a copy of the source repository like this:

        $ git clone git://git.debian.org/git/parted/parted.git
        $ cd parted

The next step is to get and check other files needed to build,
which are extracted from other source packages:

        $ ./bootstrap

And there you are!  Just

        $ ./configure #[--enable-gcc-warnings]
        $ make
        $ make check

At this point, there should be no difference between your local copy,
and the GIT master copy:

        $ git-diff

should output no difference.

Enjoy!
