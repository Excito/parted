1.8.8
=====

GNU parted is now licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3
or higher.  See the COPYING file for more details.

libparted:
- Add compute_block_counts() to improve ext2fs support.
- Properly detect 'ext2 fs too small' cases.
- Move formatting commands out of translatable strings.
- Read an msdos partition table from a device with 2K sectors.
- Remove always-false "Unable to open" diagnostic in ped_disk_new(), leave
  the "unrecognized disk label" diagnostic.
- Don't leak partition table buffer in amiga_read().
- Don't read/write initialized memory with DEBUG turned on off for 'mklabel
  bsd' and 'mklabel amiga' command calls.
- Turn off DEBUG in libparted.c to avoid initializing all allocated memory
  to '1' bits.
- Correct handling of HeaderSize field in GPT labels.
- Fix block number used when checking for ext2 fs state.
- Add detection support for Xen virtual block devices (/dev/xvd*).
- When reading DASD labels, check the filesystem type as well as partition
  flags to determine what's on the partition.
- Add _dm_probe_all() from Debian to probe for all device-mapper devices.

parted:
- Fixed exception handling in mkpart and mkpartfs commands.
- Add the --dry-run option to the partprobe command.
- Update docs: cannot specify 'primary' for a partition on a loop device.
- Remove unused functions (get_spaces).
- Fix off-by-one error in str_list_print_wrap().
- Use xmalloc() and xrealloc() to check return values.
- Fix invalid command line argument handling.
- Close memory leaks in parted.c and table.c.
- Fix warnings when compiling with translation support enabled.
- Use a consistent prompt when asking for a file system type.
- Update docs: don't reference old versions of gzip.

misc:
- Improve the testing framework in the tests/ subdirectory.  Build out more
  of the testing scripts so we can start using that to ensure we don't
  introduce regressions in releases.
- Support testing with tmpfs filesystems on Linux.
- Work around inadequate libreadline in the configure script.
- Don't include config.h from internal headers.


1.8.7
=====

libparted:
- Prevent compilation of DASD code on GNU Hurd systems.
- Integrate new unit testing framework for parted and libparted.
- Fix primary partition cylinder alignment error for DOS disk labels.
- Use PED_PARTITION_NORMAL in place of PED_PARTITION_PRIMARY.
- Avoid segfault due to a double free on reiserfs support.

parted:
- Fix script mode (-s) for mkfs command in parted.
- Suppress "you are not superuser..." warning in script mode.
- Fix off-by-one bug in parted when displaying information about the disk.
- Do not translate partition names in the 'parted print' command.  This
  causes problems for non-Latin-based character sets.
- Send errors to stderr rather than stdout.
- Handle command line options independent of the order.
- Abort on any invalid option and handle -v and -h first.
- Only display the update /etc/fstab message when there has been a change
  to the disk (a shorter and more direct message too).

1.8.6
=====

Revert the implementation of the linux-swap(new) and linux-swap(old) types.
The type is 'linux-swap' for v1, v2, and s1suspend swap partitions on Linux.


1.8.5
=====

Another minor update.  Both versions 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 lacked po translation
files.  These are included with version 1.8.5.


1.8.4
=====

Minor bug fix release for 1.8.3 to fix build issues on various platforms:
* Use 'uname -m' to determine if we build on System Z or not.
* Include <parted/vtoc.h> in <parted/fdasd.h> for format1_label_t definition.
* Remove unused variables in libparted/arch/linux.c (-Werror).
* Check return values on fgets() and asprint() in libparted/arch/linux.c
  (-Werror).
* Check for tgetent() in libtinfo in the configure script.
* Move some macro definitions in <parted/disk.h> to fix a compile problem
  with gcc-4.1.2 as indicated here:
  http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-parted/2007-03/msg00008.html
