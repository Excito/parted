1.8.7
=====

libparted:
- Prevent compilation of DASD code on GNU Hurd systems.
- Integrate new unit testing framework for parted and libparted.
- Fix primary partition cylinder alignment error for DOS disk labels.
- Use PED_PARTITION_NORMAL in place of PED_PARTITION_PRIMARY.
- Avoid segfault due to a double free on reiserfs support.

parted:
- Fix script mode (-s) for mkfs command in parted.
- Suppress "you are not superuser..." warning in script mode.
- Fix off-by-one bug in parted when displaying information about the disk.
- Do not translate partition names in the 'parted print' command.  This
  causes problems for non-Latin-based character sets.
- Send errors to stderr rather than stdout.
- Handle command line options independent of the order.
- Abort on any invalid option and handle -v and -h first.
- Only display the update /etc/fstab message when there has been a change
  to the disk (a shorter and more direct message too).
